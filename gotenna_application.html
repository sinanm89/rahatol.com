                        <p>Greetings Gotenna,</p>

<p>I wanted to apply for the fullstack developer position, Ive included my CV in the attachment.</p>

<p>I actually heard about your product a few years back when it was just an article and it grabbed my attention right away. I had been making pirateBoxes around istanbul so that people could share files and chat offline and even back then I believed your product (and mesh networking) will be a very strong milestone in IoT 2.0 </p>

<p>That being said I would love to chat and investigate a potential employment. I believe I possess all of the required talents and also most of the preferred skills. My phone number is +1 404 218 2220, I am located in Atlanta GA and have a valid employment authorization (greencard) and am willing to relocate.</p>

<p>Brief overview of my skills;</p>
<ul>
<li>- Familiar with modern python (django, twisted, flask, tornado) and Javascript (node.js, express) frameworks. (4-5 years)</li>

<li>- I try to follow TDD guidelines and try to keep unit at %85 coverage minimum. (2 years)</li>

<li>- At my prev job (scrunch) we scraped blogs and used social media API's to gather data about influencers which in turn integrated the data into a singular API endpoint which was used to build the subscription based app. We updated the features that changed and evolved bi-monthly.</li>

<li>- I used digitalocean as my personal cloud service (+5 years), have used amazon s3 and ec2 (+3 years) machines as well as a brief time with google cloud (6mo).</li>

<li>- Used Jenkins and salt config files to automate our deployment process and used axosoft, codebase, trello, github, JIRA, Asana in my other jobs as feature trackers. (2 years)</li>

<li>- Avid supporter and user of Git since my early college days. (7+ years)</li>

<li>Very interested in Machine-Learning/Artifical-Intelligence/Visual-Processing and Big Data manipulation. I have read and tried out various concepts in my self-improvement time and wish to continue my research on the subjects with in a masters degree during my employment. </li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for your consideration</p>
